# Leap Exchange Contracts

## Disclaimer
Currently, Optimism and Arbitrum have not yet been deployed on the same Ethereum testnet chains. Hence, the demo will see both the source (OptimismSrc.sol) and destination (TestOptimismDest.sol) contracts be deployed on Optimism Kovan. Liquidity providers on the destination contract side will still be required to pass a message through L1 to the source contract for the sake of demonstration.
